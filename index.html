                <p>Aspiring Computer Science student at Siena College, with minor in Data Science. I am interested in front-end web development as well as database management 
                    and am seeking opportunities related to these. Having worked in a fast-paced environment in the past, I am able to adapt to changes quickly while also 
                    maintaining both organizational and leadership skills. I've been using these skills at New York State's Office of Information Technology Services. I've 
                    been working as an intern within the Department of Transportation sector. I'm looking to showcase the skills I've learned while working as an intern 
                    and expanding these skills.
